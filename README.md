# Consumer-Goods-Insights
Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain.

## Introduction 🙋🏻‍♂️

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

## Task  

Imagine yourself as the applicant for this role and perform the following task

* Check ‘ad-hoc-requests.pdf’ - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
* You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
* The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to create a presentation to show the insights.
* Be creative with your presentation.

## Technology Stack 🔧
* MySQL Workbench CE 🐬
* Microsoft Excel 📝
* Microsoft PowerPoint 💻
* Tableau Public 🗺

## Key Learnings 👨🏻‍🎓

- I Learnt about Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and how they can be used to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Gained an understanding of the Group By clause and how it can be used to group data based on one or more columns.
- Explored the power of Window functions like Rank and Partition By to analyze data across multiple rows.

Overall, the project taught me valuable skills in SQL and data analysis that will be useful in my future work.
